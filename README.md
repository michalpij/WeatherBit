# WeatherBit

This is the original WeatherBIT API project for the IT Portfolio. The project was made using AJAX and PHP. Unfortunately I ran into some problems that mrevented me from hosting the website, this is why I decided to simplify the project into html and host it on github pages. Below you will fink a link to the repository of this simplified version.
